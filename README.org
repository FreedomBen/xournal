* This is next branch  of Xournal

This repository is to host features of xournal that are considered
stable enough for further distribution but are not part of the official xournal.

It should *not be used* for code intended for further distribution.

See https://github.com/dmgerman/xournal/blob/master/README.org for an
explanation of the development model of xournal, and the role of this
branch
