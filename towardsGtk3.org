* Moving Xournal to gtk3

- DO NOT USE YET. This branch is still broken
- There are some minor interface bugs and some major bugs
- Below I have listed the features that have been ported, but are broken

** Currently working <2013-09-30 Mon>

- Most features

** What is broken seriously (and would impede using it)

*** TODO Print

- What happened to print? Did I remove the option?

The menu item seems to be created, but it is not rendered... needs investigation

[[file:src/xo-interface.c::filePrint%20%3D%20gtk_image_menu_item_new_from_stock%20("gtk-print",%20accel_group)%3B][file:src/xo-interface.c::filePrint = gtk_image_menu_item_new_from_stock ("gtk-print", accel_group);]] 

*** TODO Page resizing

- the dialog/and its callback are broken. 
- Default values don't work

*** TODO Pixmap  backgrounds
  
- they are broken

*** TODO Selection

- Lasso selection needs to be reimplemented...

** Minor issues that need to be looked at

*** TODO Deprecations. There are still a few
 - color and font selection

*** TODO Text editing  :minor:

The resizing of the GtkTextView does not work.

*** TODO there are aliasing artifacts :minor:

Sometimes during drawing artifacts appear in the screen. 

*** TODO selection polygons are not dashed, but red 		      :minor:

- Use dash lines during selection. 
 Dashing the polygons (rectangle and polygon) requires deleting it and adding it again... 
 See email from Damon on how to do it.

* Other notes

ignore from here on. This are my notes...

** Example of a port

http://www.gtkforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=9858



** Strategy

- The API is going to be different
- First get the canvas drawn with the background
- ifdef everything else

** to be done

These are all the instances of functions used by gnomecanvas that must be replaced

  To convert between world and item coordinate systems call
  gnome-canvas-item-w2i, and to convert in the other direction call
  gnome-canvas-item-i2w. To get the transform for converting from item
  to world coordinates use gnome-canvas-item-i2w-affine or for
  converting item to canvas coordinates, gnome-canvas-item-i2c-affine.

** On units

Apparently the units are handled by just setting the type of unit. No conversion is needed.
